# 💎 Diamond Contract - Bridgeworld.lol + TreasureDAO Ecosystem

## The Core Instrument

The Diamond Contract is the **unifying instrument** for:
- **bridgeworld.lol** - Your website project
- **TreasureDAO** - Collaboration with Treasure team
- **64 Repos** - Entire ecosystem
- **22 Core Contracts** - Mapped to Aramaic glyphs (𐡀 to 𐡕)

## Core Design Principle

**"Single Contract Address, Single Proxy, Evolving Structure"**

- ✅ ONE address that never changes
- ✅ ONE proxy that delegates to facets
- ✅ Evolving structure via facet upgrades
- ✅ Self-evolving based on market conditions

## Quick Start

1. **Read the Documentation**:
   - `CORE_DESIGN.md` - Core design principles
   - `SINGLE_ADDRESS_DESIGN.md` - Single address architecture
   - `THE_BIGGER_PICTURE.md` - Full ecosystem overview
   - `22_CONTRACTS_MAPPING.md` - Contract to facet mapping
   - `ECOSYSTEM_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` - Integration strategy

2. **Review Contracts**:
   - `contracts/core/Diamond.sol` - Main proxy
   - `contracts/core/DiamondCutFacet.sol` - Upgrade mechanism
   - `contracts/core/DiamondLoupeFacet.sol` - Query interface
   - `contracts/core/OwnershipFacet.sol` - Access control

3. **Understand Integration**:
   - 22 contracts → Diamond facets
   - bridgeworld.lol → Diamond interface
   - TreasureDAO → Diamond ecosystem
   - 64 repos → Diamond connections

## Architecture
