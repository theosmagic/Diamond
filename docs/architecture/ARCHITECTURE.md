# 🏗️ Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Diamond Framework**
   - Control Center: Central orchestration
   - Socket System: Glyph-to-script mapping
   - Combinations Engine: Sequence processing

2. **Autonomous Agents**
   - Yield Engine: Algorithmic optimization
   - Multisig Bots: Safe wallet integration
   - Worker Bees: Asset management

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Tenderly: Simulation and analytics
   - Metaverse: Gaming token operations
   - Cross-chain: Multi-network support

### Data Flow

```
User Intent → Glyph Sequence → Agent Processing → Safe Execution → Blockchain
```

### Security Model

- **Multi-layer Security**: Glyph constants + combination validation
- **Autonomous Thresholds**: Confidence-based execution
- **Emergency Safeguards**: Master key override system
